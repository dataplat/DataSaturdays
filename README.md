# DataSaturdays
A repository for open sourcing a solution for Data Saturdays. Data Saturdays would be based on the SQL Saturday model of local events organized under a common banner for marketing purposes.

UPDATE 18/12/2020 - We have created a placeholder website at DataSaturdays.com hosted on Github Pages
