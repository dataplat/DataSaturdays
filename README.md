# DataSaturdays

This repository has been created as a place for the community create a set of tools and single point to enable people to run small regional events with little outlay or set-up diffculties to have open, transparent discussions on how it should be set up and utilised.

UPDATE 18/12/2020 - We have created a placeholder website at [DataSaturdays.com](https://datasaturdays.com) hosted on Github Pages

## Wiki

There is a [wiki](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/DataSaturdays/wiki) which will hold a lot of the documentation - As of 20/12/2020 it is pretty empty - Lets make it better!

## New Events

There is no process for new events at present other than by adding to this issue - https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/DataSaturdays/wiki/A-New-Event

## Goals

- Provide a website for listing events taking place around the world
- Enable event owners to be able to set up the website and administer it easily
- Administrative tools for event organizers to use when building their site
- Integration with various payment providers for different locales
- Integration with mobile scheduling applications
- Page to list all sponsors and their contacts
- Rating of sessions and events
- Speaker tools
- Sponsor tools

However, this is not to say that these tools should be created by the community in this repository. To paraphrase Jeffrey Snover, don't build what you don't need to, concentrate on the things that provide value. My view is that some of these things already exist and what is required is a way to consolidate them and make it easy for people to use them. Don't re-invent the wheel.

## Culture

We expect and demand that you follow some basic rules. Nothing dramatic here. There will be a proper code of conduct for the websites added soon, but in this repository

**BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER**

Do I need to say more? 
If your behaviour or communication does not fit into this statement, we do not wish for you to help us.

## What can you do?

We have issues https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/DataSaturdays/issues   
We would like you to comment on them and provide help and assistance  
We will have code to write and CI/CD to create  
We have no idea what else is required, thats for you, the community, to decide  

## What this is not
