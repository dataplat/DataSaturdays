<p>Even the best logical model can’t help when the physical implementation is bad. Therefore, it is important to know how SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and partially also Azure Synapse Analytics, store data in row and columnar format and how the engines access this data. You will learn about heaps, balanced trees, and columnar indexes. In addition, this course introduces query optimization for both, transactional and analytical queries.</p>

codeofconduct: "<p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to adhere with the following code of conduct. 
      Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
    </p>

    <h2>The Short Version</h2>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Our conference is dedicated to providing an enjoyable environment for everyone involved. 
      Thus providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, 
      gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
      body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. 
      We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. 
      Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, 
      including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. 
      Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or 
      expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion 
      of the conference organizers.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      The organizer of this event will prioritize marginalized people&#39;s safety over privileged people&#39;s comfort.
    </p>

    <h2>The Less Short Version</h2>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender 
      identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical 
      appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, 
      sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, 
      following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of 
      talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome 
      sexual attention.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply 
      immediately.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, 
      sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. 
      Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized 
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers 
      may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender 
      or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or 
      have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff 
      immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing 
      branded shirts.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact 
      local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist 
      those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the 
      conference. We value your attendance.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop 
      venues and conference-related social events.
    </p>
