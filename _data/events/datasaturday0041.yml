    <p>
    Developing a centralized repository of data is only useful when you can use it to better explain what is going on in your organization, and for that you are going to want to create Power BI reports to provide that analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
    Designing for large scale models is different as one needs to be able to accommodate data from multiple different sources and include complex transformations. Data solutions need to accommodate different types of users including methods to support departments as well as releasing enterprise-wide reports.
    </p>
    <p>
    Data models should be able to provide ad hoc querying, data science as well as self-service reporting models. To govern the solution, there needs to be a plan for providing a location for people to find the answers to the questions they may have about access, design and security in a user accessible design.
    </p>
    <p>
    During this all day session we will explore the following topics
      - Power BI Large Scale modeling
      - Enterprise Data Transformation Techniques
      - Release management and lifecycle of Workspaces and Apps 
      - Data Security and Source Control 
      - Self Service Reporting Techniques
      - Power BI Governance
    </p>
    <p>
    As part of the session attendees will gain hands on experience to apply the skills discussed on their own laptops.

codeofconduct: "<p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to adhere with the following code of conduct.
      Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
    </p>
    <h2>The Short Version</h2>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Our conference is dedicated to providing an enjoyable environment for everyone involved.
      Thus providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
      gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
      body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
      We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
      Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
      including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.
      Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
      expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion
      of the conference organizers.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      The organizer of this event will prioritize marginalized people&#39;s safety over privileged people&#39;s comfort.
    </p>
    <h2>The Less Short Version</h2>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
      identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
      appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
      sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
      following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
      talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
      sexual attention.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
      sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
      Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers
      may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
      or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
      have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
      immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing
      branded shirts.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact
      local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
      those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
      conference. We value your attendance.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop
      venues and conference-related social events.
    </p>
