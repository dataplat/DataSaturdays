  During these days after the unprovoked aggressive attack by Russia on Ukraine, it is hard to find the right words for our CfS announcement. 
  We have friends living in Ukraine and friends from Ukraine living here in Norway with family stuck in a terrible situation in their home country. 
  We were looking forward to welcome you all to Oslo for our first in-person event in two years and understandably our excitement about this announcement has been dialed down to zero due to the Russian attack.

    </p>
    <p>
    The pre-con breaks down the Synapse Analytics in its elements and gives you a solid foundation of knowledge on most important of them. We will cover :
    <br>
    •	The concept and architecture of combining big data and relational data in one data platform
    <br>
    •	SQL Dedicated Pool – how it works, how to load data, optimizing the physical database design and the performance
    <br>
    •	Azure Data Lakehouse with Built-in Pool including data lake common design rules

    Making Data Matter - Combining Data, Visual Storytelling and Presentation Skills for Maximum Impact
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 1.3rem;\">
    with <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/alexanderarvidsson\">Alexander Arvidsson</a>

    <img src=\"../assets/img/events/0023/alexander_arvidsson.png\" height=\"170\" alt=\"Alexander Arvidsson\" style=\"margin-left: 35px; margin-right: 35px;border-radius: 50%;\">

    <p>
    A friend once explained her experience with a \"data driven company\" like this: \"we collect millions of points of data every day, we clean it, we analyse it, we make it actionable - and then we implement whatever happens to be the mood of the day\". 
    </p>
    <p>
    Power BI is one of the most powerful tools for data professionals and business users alike. It makes it possible to create amazing reports providing deep insight into just about any data. The insights this tool unlocks can drive decisions at every level - but do they? 
    </p>
    <p>
    Why is it then, that in this age of \"data-driven decisionmaking\", that so many decisions are still based on \"gut feeling\"? 
    <br>
    One of the reasons is that we still like to think that data will drive decisions on its own. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The challenge is using Power BI to efficiently communicating said insight.
    </p>
    <p>
    Efficiently communicating data means not only being able to clearly and concisely visualizing it, but also being able to explain why the data matters to your audience - in a way that is engaging, interesting and relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
    This, in turn, require knowledge of how to write a compelling story that is engaging and relatable for your audience, as well as presentation skills to help bridge the gap between data and people.
    </p>
    <p>
    By making the data and the story matter to the audience we can align feelings with hard data, essentially influencencing decisions and improving business outcomes. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In this full-day workshop, you will learn the skills to take your ability to communicate using Power BI to a whole new level.
    <br>
    We will start with an overview of the fundamentals of visual communication in order to make the foundation of our data storytelling as clear, concise and understandable as can be.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will then discuss how to craft a relevant and relatable story to build on top of our data. We will learn how, through a clear message with a clear structure, to apply classic storytelling techniques as suspense, surprise and conflict to a technical narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally we will explore how to improve your presentation skills to enable you to bridge the gap between the data and people to really drive your point home.
    </p>
    <p>
    Come join me to level up your Power BI communication skills!

      Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
    </p>

    <h2>The Short Version</h2>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Our conference is dedicated to providing an enjoyable environment for everyone involved. 
      Thus providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, 
      gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
      body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. 
      We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. 
      Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, 
      including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. 
      Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or 
      expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion 
      of the conference organizers.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      The organizer of this event will prioritize marginalized people&#39;s safety over privileged people&#39;s comfort.
    </p>

    <h2>The Less Short Version</h2>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender 
      identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical 
      appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, 
      sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, 
      following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of 
      talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome 
      sexual attention.
    </p>
    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply 
      immediately.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, 
      sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. 
      Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized 
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers 
      may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender 
      or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or 
      have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff 
      immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing 
      branded shirts.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact 
      local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist 
      those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the 
      conference. We value your attendance.
    </p>

    <p style=\"text-align:left;\">
      We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop 
      venues and conference-related social events.
