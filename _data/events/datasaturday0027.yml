<h1>Birthday in Italy</h1>
I want to visit Gianluca on my birthday so I have created this event so that I can. (ok maybe it is just to test some automation!)<br>
<br>
I just want to be able to spend some time with him and this is my birthday so I think I should be allowed.<br>

With some more information<br>

Maybe it will work<br>
