We are proud to announce the first day long event for 2021 – Data Platform WIT Day – March 5th 2021. This will be a day long virtual event with all women speakers – some on non tech issues and some on hard core tech topics.
<br>
We will start the day at 8.30 AM EST with a keynote by former WIT lead and current Senior program manager for MVP Support at Microsoft – Rie Merrit (t | l).
<br>
This will be followed by various sessions as below. We worked hard to make the speaker selection diverse ethnically, and find a balance between tech and non tech subjects. It is our first event so this will evolve in the future. Please sign up for our event here – you will be emailed zoom links for the classes closer to date.
