We plan on providing training sessions focusing on data technologies locally and in the cloud, providing content on data analytics, machine learning, SQL, business intelligence, data architecture and much more.
Data Saturday will be held on March 23, 2024 to provide training to all who want to learn how to elevate their careers to the next level.  We will be hosting this event on the campus of Grand Canyon University Please register soon as seating is limited, and let friends and colleagues know about the event.
