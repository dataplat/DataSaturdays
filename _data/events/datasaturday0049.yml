Data Saturday Denmark is a one-day event for professionals who use the Microsoft data platform. This community event offer content across data management, cloud and hybrid architecture, analytics, business intelligence, AI, and more.

The community revolves around Microsoft Data Platform and Cloud (Fabric, Power BI, SQL Server, Synapse, Azure, PowerShell, etc), but we invite other topics as well (other cloud vendors, interesting technologies).

At this point, we are not able to cover any travel/accommodation expenses.

The event is a free in-person event.
